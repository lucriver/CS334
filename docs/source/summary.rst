Comp Viz Summary
================

Comp Viz is a computer vision oriented package that aims to allow those unfamiliar with the subject to
explore and experiment with various computer vision related tasks like object detection, image segmentation,
classification, and more.

Comp Viz is built using MXNet's gluoncv API. Comp Viz aims to provide a simple and intuitive abstraction
layer over gluoncv to allow even the most novice users to experiment with computer vision.

Comp Viz currently only supports object detection tasks, but in the near future aims to add support for
classification and image segmentation.

Comp Viz is a package currently composed of two subpackages- object_detection, which contains the model module,
allowing for object detection related tasks, and the utils sub package, which hosts a variety of helper
functions to better interact with, but not limited to, other comp viz subpackages.
